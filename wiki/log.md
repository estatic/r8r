# Wiki Log

Append-only chronological record of operations on the wiki. Each entry begins with `## [YYYY-MM-DD] <op> | <description>` so it's parseable with `grep "^## \[" log.md | tail -N`.

Operations:
- `ingest` — a source was processed into the wiki.
- `query` — a question was answered against the wiki (typically only logged when the answer was filed back as synthesis).
- `lint` — a health check was run.
- `schema` — the schema was modified.
- `shard` — an index was sharded.
